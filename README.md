Tanui Industries is seeking to digitize its inventory-keeping process. As part of this
undertaking, you as the lead developer are required to design and implement a
simple API using firebase cloud functions that can Create, Update, Read and Delete
inventory.

Implementation Instructions
- You are required to use Firebase cloud firestore as your primary database.
- Create a firebase project and initialize cloud functions.
- Create four firebase HTTP trigger endpoints - Create Inventory, Update
Inventory, Get Inventory and Delete Inventory.
- Ensure that the endpoints can seed and update data from your primary cloud
firestore database.
